Its first kingdomwas noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) and the Joseondynasty (1392\u20131897). The succeeding Korean Empire (1897\u20131910) was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. In 1945, after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, Korea was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States. In 1948, separate governments were formed in Korea: the socialist and Soviet-aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist, Western-aligned Republic of Korea in the south. North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950 started the Korean War. In 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefireand established a demilitarized zone (DMZ), but no formal peace treaty has ever been signed.", "slug": "paju-si", "display_slug": "paju-si", "type": 1, "start_time": 1731551471.106672, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1731551476.981217, "location": {"id": 165972515, "name": "Paju-si", "detail": "South Korea", "full_detail": "Gyeonggi, South Korea", "country_code": "KR", "lat": 37.890753100549134, "lon": 126.74056500491886, "venue": null, "uuid": "0FC5F2A9-F918-4E12-831F-C7EF6EF2D943"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "Asia/Seoul", "views": 0, "comment_count": 0, "weather_condition": "partly-cloudy-day", "weather_temperature": 16.0, "uuid": "53CE4E52-A8DC-4292-85C1-F785F73A76B5"}, {"id": 134210792, "trip_id": 14916530, "location_id": 165977093, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Dora Observatory Tower", "display_name": "Dora Observatory Tower", "description": "We then entered into the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the buffer area that surrounds the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) or exact line that separates North and South Korea.
