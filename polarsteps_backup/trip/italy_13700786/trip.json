And we met some wonderful people at the beach (who were on holiday). But overall, people were cold and not very helpful or friendly. It was hard because I did so much research on the area, I thought it would be a perfect home base for a longer stay. It was really good to have a slower pace here, catch up on school and work.

This famous and important church is built on Peter, Christ\u2019s apostle, tomb. The dome is the largest dome on earth. The dome is so tall that you could fit the statue of liberty inside it. We climbed the 551 stairs to the top of the dome and were rewarded with magnificent views of Rome and Vatican City. \n\nInside the Basilica was stunning with art, mosaics, statues, and other amazing structures.

The ceiling frescoes took Michelangelo four years to complete. In total, they cover 12,000 square feet.  He did not ulay down to paint, but built scaffolding.

It was built in 6-7th century BC and had approximately 20,000 inhabitants. It was a wealthy town with lots of shops, restaurants, spas, arenas, amphitheaters and houses. It has beautiful frescoes, intricate tile work, and beautiful sculptures. Unknowingly, this town was sitting beneath one of the most deadly volcanoes in the world. Seismic activity was probably common in this area; a large earthquake (5-6 on Richter scale) damaged buildings in 62 AD. \n\nThen in 79 AD was the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The eruption may have lasted about 18 hours. During the first phase is eruption, the volcano vomited hot gas, ash, and pulverized pumice, which caved in roofs in Pompeii and toppled treesh. Although some inhabitants of the city were crushed during this phase, most were able to escape. Next came a series of \u201cpyroclastic surges,\u201d during which turbulent masses of hot ash and lava obliterated any remaining people and structures. Approximately 2,000 died. \n\nPompeii was buried and preserved under a 7 meter deep layer of ash and pumice for the next 17 centuries. Archaeological excavations started to take place in the mid-17th century. In 1990s 2/3rds of the city had been excavated. Voids in the ash were left were left by decomposed organic material, these were filled with plaster leaving images of how the victims (men, women, children, dogs, bread, etc) were when the  high-temperature pyroclastic flow hit them.\n\nWe took the train to Pompeii and had an archaeological guide show us some of the highlights of the historic city.

It has erupted many times in history, with of course the most notable being in 79 AD. The most notable are 1800 BC, 79 AD, 472, 1631, and lastly in 1944. The many eruptions leading up to 1944 meant that this eruption was not very explosive. We saw the lava fields from that eruption. It is estimated that the next eruption will be very explosive. That, and the fact that 3 million people live at its base in Naples makes this volcano one of the most deadly out there. Its activity is closely monitored, and seems to be sleeping for now. However, on the other side of Naples is the Phlegraean Fields, a large caldera volcano, that is increasingly of concern. Just March of this year there was a large earthquake (4.4 magnitude) and other signs of activity. In response to the rising threat, Italian authorities have an evacuation plan to relocate over a half million people in just 3 days. However, after seeing their city, traffic, and using the public transportation there, I hope it is enough!!\n\nFun fact- before the 79AD Pompeii eruption, there Mount Somma\u2013Vesuvius volcano was about 2-3km tall. Now there are two peaks, Mount Somma (1,132 m) and Mount Vesuvius (1,281 m).\n", "slug": "ottaviano", "display_slug": "ottaviano", "type": 1, "start_time": 1726749000.0, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1726773845.304967, "location": {"id": 155533694, "name": "Ottaviano", "detail": "Italy", "full_detail": "Campania, Italy", "country_code": "IT", "lat": 40.819052153004044, "lon": 14.425502983456823, "venue": null, "uuid": "4D455383-5C2C-4196-801F-7B9AE9432999"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "Europe/Rome", "views": 0, "comment_count": 0, "weather_condition": "rain", "weather_temperature": 24.0, "uuid": "1C476498-1A7C-4B68-8BAB-2EF471C110B0"}, {"id": 125794028, "trip_id": 13700786, "location_id": 155535667, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Naples", "display_name": "Naples", "description": "Last night in Italy!! \n\nWe spent our last night in Italy at a B&B that we wish we had more time at.
