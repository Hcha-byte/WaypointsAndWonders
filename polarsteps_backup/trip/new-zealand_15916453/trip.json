Today we visited the signing house and grounds. We had a guided tour and got to see a Ma\u014dri dance performance. There was also a group rehearsing the Haka in preparation for the Waitangi Day celebration.\n\nA brief history of New Zealand:\n\nThe New Zealand land mass is quite young geologically. At the base is a microcontinent Zealandia that broke off from Gondwana 85 million years ago. But most of New Zealand\u2019s current land mass comes from the uplift from volcanoes at the convergence of the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates.\n\nNew Zealand was the last large, habitable land mass to be discovered by humans. The first people to arrive in New Zealand were Polynesian ancestors of the M\u0101ori, between 1200 and 1300 AD. The distinct Ma\u014dri culture was formed. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. The name New Zealand comes from the Dutch \u2018Nieuw Zeeland\u2019, the name first given by a Dutch mapmaker. The Englishman Captain James Cook arrived here in 1769. European whalers and sealers then started visiting regularly, followed by traders. By the 1830s, the British government was being pressured to reduce lawlessness in the country and to settle here before the French, who were considering New Zealand as a potential colony.\n\nOn February 6, 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by the British Crown and over 500 M\u0101ori chiefs. The treaty was an agreement between that established British sovereignty over New Zealand, while guaranteeing M\u0101ori rights to their land and culture, essentially serving as the founding document of the country and laying the foundation for a bicultural society; however, the treaty's interpretation remains complex due to discrepancies between the English and M\u0101ori versions, leading to ongoing debates about its meaning and implementation throughout New Zealand's history. These differences lead to the New Zealand Wars of 1845 to 1972. In 1907, New Zealand became a dominion within the British Empire.

It produces a captivating blue-green bioluminescent light, where in large numbers, look like starry night sky and attracts prey into its sticky silk traps.\n\nThe life cycle of the glow worm, like most insects, has four stages:\n\nEggs: A female fly lays around 130 small eggs. After around 20 days, the young larvae hatch from the eggs.\n\nLarva: Having hatched, the larvae build a nest, put lines down and feed. The lines are coated with sticky substances. It is this sticky coating which traps insects. The lines are then drawn up and the insects eaten. It is the larva that emit the light in order to attract the insects to the lines. They live as larva (with 5 instar stages) for about 9 months.\n\nPupae: In the pupae stage, a cocoon like structure is formed and the larva transitions to its adult form over 12-13 days.\n\nAdult: They then emerge as adult fungus gnats. The females are much larger and emit a special \u201cmating\u201d bioluminescence. The males can fly weakly and will mate with as many females as possible in its short 6 day life span. Females generally mate immediately after emergence and fly very weakly. Females live 2-3 days and die after egg laying. Neither sex adult forms have functional mouth parts and do not feed as adults.

However, they are nocturnal and very hard to see in the wild. Kiwis are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand. New Zealand doesn\u2019t have any native mammals, except for a few bat species, so with the introduction by humans of predators such as dogs, stoats, possums, rats and others, the kiwi populations have declined. There are hatcheries across the country that incubate, hatch, brood, and raise young chicks until they are big enough to have a surviving chance in the wild. This is greatly helping the kiwis, especially until the other pests are eradicated.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t take photos inside, but we saw 3 kiwis in nocturnal enclosure, we saw eggs incubating, an egg in the hatching process, a new chick that hatched yesterday, and some young chicks in the brooders (one of which we saw get its weight check and it is now big enough to go in the outside enclosure! The handler showed us its little vestigial wings), and the outside enclosures. It was really neat! Such a cool bird!!\n\nHere are some kiwi facts:\n\n-Kiwi are ratites, related to other flightless birds like ostrich, emu, and cassowary.\n-There are 5 species of kiwi, all endemic to New Zealand \n-It has loose feathers that are more like fur and unlike other birds the feathers moult throughout the year.\n-It is the only bird in the world with nostrils at the end of its beak.\n-Its sense of smell is second to none.\n-It has no tail feathers but does have whiskers, like a cat.\n-It has marrow in its bones, just like a human.\n-Very unusually, females have two ovaries, most birds have only one.\n-Kiwi eggs are large in comparison to the mother kiwi, and are among the largest eggs of any bird. A single egg can weigh up to 20% of the mother kiwi's body weight. A female typically lays four eggs in a season. The male incubates the eggs for 74-90 days\n-it takes 5 days for the kiwi to hatch. When first hatched, the belly of the chick is swollen with yolk which will sustain them for their first few days.\n-Kiwi birds are typically monogamous and mate for life. \n- The main breeding season for kiwi birds is from June to March, when food is most abundant. \n-In the wild, female kiwi birds usually lay their first eggs at 3\u20135 years old. \n\n\nOutside the hatchery they had a Kiwi Fruit orchard.

It was a two-day hike with a hut stay at Rod Donald Hut. \n\nTo start, we took a shuttle from Christchurch to the Banks Peninsula. Volcanic activity between 11 and 6 million years ago led formed two overlapping volcanic cones. After this activity ceased, the volcanic complex eroded to half its original height, and deep valleys formed. Harbors were formed when the valleys were flooded as the sea level rose to its present height about 6,000 years ago. We got off the shuttle at Hilltop where we started the hike with gorgeous views of the Akaroa harbor. \n\nThe hut has 9 bunks, a VIP toliet (pretty awesome composting pit toliet), and an eating area with sinks and tables. We shared the hut with a couple of moms with young kids (3 yo and infant) - so our sleep wasn't the best. But the hut was really nice and fun.\n\nThe hike went through a lot of sheep and cow pastures. We frequently had to cross fences to follow the trail. We got scenic views of the harbors on both sides of the peninsula. We saw giant Totara trees and walked through windswept Totara forests. Totara trees are considered a \"taonga\" (treasure) by M\u0101ori people. \n\nWe ended in Diamond Harbor where we took the ferry to Lyttelton.\n\nDay 1 stats: 14.3km (8.9mi), 727.8m (2,388ft), 4:33 total time (4:20 moving time)\nDay 2 stats: 16.4km (10.2mi), 659.8m (2,165ft), 4:46 total time (4:30 moving)\n", "slug": "te-ara-pataka-summit-walkway", "display_slug": "te-ara-pataka-summit-walkway", "type": 1, "start_time": 1742449213.0, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1744244515.0, "location": {"id": 189040302, "name": "Banks Peninsula Community", "detail": "New Zealand", "full_detail": "Banks Peninsula Community, Christchurch City, Canterbury, New Zealand", "country_code": "NZ", "lat": -43.699686323003576, "lon": 172.74406944620551, "venue": null, "uuid": "9d51da45-ae75-4536-a2d7-69d02cc68f71"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "Pacific/Auckland", "views": 0, "comment_count": 0, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 18.0, "uuid": "159dd3f0-9f5a-44ee-aca4-3617ba1dbe08"}, {"id": 152646190, "trip_id": 15916453, "location_id": 189040965, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "School Assembly", "display_name": "School Assembly", "description": "Fran\u2019s school has an assembly every Friday morning.

A fjord is a long, narrow sea inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by a glacier. For some reason, in New Zealand they spell it fiord instead of the typically fjord spelling. The first Europeans who came here were more focused on the fact that this deep inlet offered a safe place to shelter and collect food, water and wood. So they described it as \u2018safe and sound'. Hence the name.\n\nIn te reo M\u0101ori, the fiord is known as Piopiotahi after the now extinct piopio, a thrush-like bird that used to inhabit New Zealand. According to the M\u0101ori legend of M\u0101ui trying to win immortality for mankind, a single piopio flew to the fiord in mourning following M\u0101ui's death.
