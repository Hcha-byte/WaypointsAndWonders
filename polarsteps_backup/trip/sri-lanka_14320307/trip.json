From these three leaves four different teas are produced:\n   First leaf = white tea\n   First and second \u200e\u2009=\u2009 green\n   Third = golden\n   All three = black\n\nWe were shown the process to wash, dry, chop, sieve and sort the leaves. Then tasted the four types. White was by far the best.\n\nI thought a lot today about modern day slavery. Tea was introduced to the country by the British when under colonial rule m. To help work the fields Tamils were brought over from India in the 19th century. These people are still same of the most disadvantaged in the country and face many hardships, with no power. Of course this wasn\u2019t brought up in our tour.

There are countless number of village dogs walking along the road, or laying in the road. One day, Fran counted 78 dog\u2019s in about 1.5 hours of driving. Also, watch out for wildlife. We saw giant snails, monkeys, lizards, elephants, land monitors, mongoose and peacocks. Then there is the livestock: cows, buffalo, chickens, or goats. You have small trucks or tuk tuks loaded up with produce, or sugar cane, or lots of people. Or they take up a whole lane of the road to dry rice. In the cities, you have the school kids walking home from school in their white uniforms. You have shops and temples along the side of the road.\n\nYou have people walking, carts, bikes, scooters, tuk tuks, cars, trucks, and buses. Everyone trying to pass everyone else, and no one stop for anybody. Oh, and to intensify this craziness, it is right hand drive.\n\nThis video is speed up and through a small town, so very little going on.\n\nBUT\u2026 the scenery was gorgeous! The mountains and trees. The buffalos grazing with the egrets. I loved the rice paddy\u2019s and the tea plantations terraced into the hills.
